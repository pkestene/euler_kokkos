/** \brief ErrorPolling provides utilities for establishing agreement
 * between processors on whether an std::exception has been detected on any one
 * processor.
 *
 * The two functions must be used in a coordinated way. The simplest use
 * case is to embed a call to reportFailure() whenever an std::exception is
 * detected at the top-level try/catch block, and then to do a call to
 * pollForFailures() whenever it is desired to check for off-processor
 * errors before proceeding. The macro

  \code
  TEST_FOR_FAILURE(comm);
  \endcode

 * calls pollForFailures() and throws an std::exception if the return value is
 * true.
 *
 * Polling is a collective operation (an MPI_Reduce) and so incurs some
 * performance overhead. It can be disabled with a call to
 * \code
 * hydroSimu::ErrorPolling::disable();
 * \endcode
 * IMPORTANT: all processors must agree on whether collective error checking
 * is enabled or disabled. If there are inconsistent states, the reduction
 * operations in pollForFailures() will hang because some processors cannot be
 * contacted.
